# Helpful Human Interview Challenge
**by Curtis Yungen**

August 2019

This is my solution to the Helpful Human Interview Challenge. Directions for the challenge can be found here: https://github.com/HelpfulHuman/interview-challenge.

Check out my deployed project here: https://hh-interview.herokuapp.com.

### Reflection

Overall comments:
* I spent about 8 hours working on this project.
* Most time was spent on the getHexCodes algorithm which admittedly isn't very impressive. Most color shades are very similar. 

What I liked: 
* I think the interface turned out well.
* I like the pagination.

What I'd improve: 
* I need to figure out how to make the first-time load quicker, likely by splitting up the App.js file into smaller ones.
* I'm curious to see a more optimal algorithm for generating non-random hex codes. 
* I'd better utilize Bootstrap so I can avoid tedious media queries. 
* I looked at some <b>GraphQL</b> tutorials but decided to leave it out for this project. I'm interested in learning more about it though.
